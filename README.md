# Task-5-EDA
In this task, I performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the Titanic dataset using Python. I worked in Google Colab and used libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## What I Did:

- Loaded and explored the dataset with `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`
- Checked class distributions with `.value_counts()`
- Created visualizations: histograms, boxplots, pairplot, heatmap
- Wrote short observations for each chart based on what I noticed

## Tools I Used:

- Google Colab (Python 3)
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- MS Word (for writing the report)
